# v2.1.0

This release features a number of new methods (a steady state viscosity for the dislocation-based backstress model, an implementation of the Warren & Hirth 2006 grain size piezometer and a new analytical maxwell anelastic model) as well a new reference anharmonic scaling for the upper mantle.

A bug fix release to address issues with calculation of elastic moduli when using the chi-mixing for moduli that were introduced in VBRc version 2.0.0 (prior versions were unaffected). This work also includes a bunch of updates to testing infrastructure to automatically run the cookbook examples in the test suite. 

## Bug fixes

## Infrastructure improvements

* [#181](https://github.com/vbr-calc/vbr/pull/181) added an automated test that runs all cookbook examples, which included some updates to testing and support functions:

    * some minimal field value validation for many fields in the output VBR structure
    * a new function, `get_nested_field_from_struct` let's you get a nested structure field by supplying a cell string "path" to the field: `Q = get_nested_field_from_struct(VBR, {'out'; 'anelastic'; 'andrade_psp'; 'Q'})`. 
    * a new function, `concat_cell_strs` concatenates all the strings in a cell array of strings, `concat_cell_strs({'hello'; 'there'}, '_')` will result in `hello_there`.

# v2.0.0

This release of the VBRc introduces a few small but potentially breaking changes with the anharmonic calculation and also introduces a new anelastic method, the `backstress_linear` method for dislocation-based dissipation. See below for more details.

## New Features

* updates to the anharmonic calculation (PR166)[https://github.com/vbr-calc/vbr/pull/166]. Check out the updated docs page: https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/vbrmethods/el/anharmonic/ but here's an overview of the changes:
    * adds new flags for specifying the temperature and pressure scaling to use
    * removes the fixed poisson ratio and instead calculates a bulk modulus following the shear modulus method: there are now fields for reference bulk modulus and temperature, pressure derivatives. 
    * adds a pressure scaling from Abramson et al 1997

* new anelastic method! `backstress_linear` implements the linearized backstress model of dislocation-based dissipation from Hein et al., 2025. See the docs and new example: [docs](https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/vbrmethods/anel/backstresslinear/), [cookbook example](https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/examples/CB_017_backstress_model/). 

## Documentation 

* add VBRc workshop links to readme in [162](https://github.com/vbr-calc/vbr/pull/162)

## Infrastructure improvements

* update to matlab-actions in [156](https://github.com/vbr-calc/vbr/pull/156)

# v1.2.0

## New Features
* new method: analytical_andrade, see [documentation](https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/vbrmethods/anel/andradeanalytical/) for detials.
* updates to xfit_premelt: 
  * add direct melt effects from Yamauchi and Takei, 2024. The `xfit_premelt` method will use the updated parameter values when `VBR.in.anelastic.xfit_premelt.include_direct_melt_effect = 1;` (default is 0, a future VBRc version will change the default to 1).
  * change default exponential melt factor (the alpha in exp(-alpha*phi) in the viscosity relationship) from 25 to 30. 
* add a `VBR_save` function for saving `VBR` structures
* add convenience function, `full_nd`, to create filled arrays

Bug fix release.

## bug fixes

- rename `Project/bayesian_fitting/run.m` to `run_bayes.m` to avoid name conflict.

# v1.0.0

This is the first series-1 release! It is backwards compatible.

## new features

- units metadata: `VBR.in.SV` as well as all output methods now contain a units structure that contains the units for each field. You can also call `SV_input_units()` to get a structure that lists the expected units for each `VBR.in.SV` field.
- version tracking: after calling `VBR_spine`, all `VBR` structures will have a field, `VBR.version_used` with info on the VBR version that you used.
- a new function for calculating density as a function of pressure, using an interpolation of experimental measurements on F90 San Carlos olivine, `san_carlos_density_from_pressure`, following Abramson et al., JGR, 1997. Useful for
quickly calculating olivine density for a given pressure.

## bug fixes

(add bug fixes)

## changes

- some of the functions related to non-seismic material properties used in the forward
models directory have been moved and renamed. No change in usage, but it is now easier
to use those functions in a piecemeal fashion if desired. See functions in the `density`
and `thermal_properties` subdirectories within `vbr/vbrCore/fucntions/` for available
functions.

# v0.99.4

## new features

- `vbr_version()` function, returns the version of the VBRc that you are using
