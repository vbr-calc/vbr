How to fit your seismic observables:
This doc describes the current workflow.  Anything with an * indicates that it
could/should be updated in the future.

This doc contains more detail and pulls information from various comments
together, though just stepping section-by-section through the codes
fit_seismic_observations.m and fit_plate.m should be pretty self-explanatory.


run.m will run both of these codes, and pulls out the most important variables.

################## Start of fit_seismic_observations ########################

############## 1. Get data for Vs(x, f) and Q(x, f) ##############
This section loads in the seismic observations, and extracts the observed
data point and its standard deviation.

The seismic observations are assumed to be saved in some file, xxxx.mat,
that contains a single variable (name irrelevant, as it is renamed to Model)
[obs_name]_Model    structure with the following fields
   Latitude    n_lat vector of latitude points [degrees N]
   Longitude   n_lon vector of longitude points [degrees E]
                (can be negative - code will add 360 degrees to negative values)
  Depth        n_dep vector of depth points [km]
  [obs_name]  (n_lat, n_lon, n_dep) matrix of values of this
               seismic property based on observations
  Error       (n_lat, n_lon, n_dep) matrix of uncertainty of this seismic
              property based on observations. This is often not reported!
              As such, if there is no such field in the saved .mat file,
              a default value is assumed, with a message printed to screen.

--- Things you should change:
      - location.lat, location.lon - (lat, lon) of your desired point
      - location.z_min, location.z_max - depth range from which to extract
          the observed data, i.e. asthenospheric depth range
          * Currently just set up front, though we could go back to plotting
          the Vs or Q profile and picking the depth range on the figure
      - filenames.Vs, filenames.Q - the filenames of the saved seismic
          observations in the format described above
      - If you only want to fit Vs or Q, delete the innapropriate fieldname
          from the filenames structure.
--- Functions called:
      - functions/process_SeismicModels()
          This returns the prior pdf, observed value and standard deviation
          given an input location and model file
--- Returns:
      - obs_[Vs|Q]     value of seismic observation at location
      - sigma_[Vs|Q]   standard deviation of seismic observation at location


############## 2. Get prior for State Variables ##############
This section preferably loads in a previously calculated sweep across a
range of values of T, phi, gs and calculates the average Vs and Q across
all depths (well, 0-300 km) for the given frequency range.  If no such sweep
has been saved, it will calculate a fresh one.  It then calculates a prior
probability for each variable, assuming some form of pdf across the range of
each of the state variables.
* At the moment, the only option is to give a vector of values (though could
be of length 1) for each of T, phi, gs - and there is no possibility to vary
any other parameter.  Could update this to be more flexible.

--- Things you should change:
      - fname - the file name of your previously calculated sweep
      - If you want to recalculate, alter the variables in the if statement
          sweep_params.T - vector of possible temperatures, [degrees C]
                            (note not potential temperature)
          sweep_params.phi - vector of possible melt fractions
          sweep_params.gs - vector of possible grain sizes [μm]
          sweep_params.per_bw_max, per_bw_min - the period range of interest [s]
      - qmethod - attenuation method for anelastic calculations
      - pdf_type - set to {'uniform'} or {'normal'} (or with a cell of length 3,
          you could set different pdf types for each of T, phi, gs)
--- Functions called:
      - functions/generate_parameter_sweep()
          Calculate a big parameter sweep if you don't already have one saved
      - functions/extract_values_in_depth_range()
          This pulls the VBR calculated values from the parameter sweep given
          some Q method and a depth range.
      - functions/make_param_grid()
          This reformats the structure 'sweep' into something easier to work
          with for calculating the prior pdf - grids the vectors of parameters
          and calculates a mean and standard deviation for the parameter range.
          Note that if your pdf_type = {'uniform'}, this mean and std will not
          be used.  You can also manually change these after calling this
          function and before calling priorModelProbs()
      - ../vbr/6_FitVobs/matlab_FittingFunctions/priorModelProbs()
          This calculates the joint prior pdf of the state variables according
          to the input pdf_type and assuming that all of the state variables
          are independent of each other
            i.e. p(T=T0, phi=phi0, gs=gs0) = p(T=T0) * p(phi=phi0) * p(gs = gs0)
          * We are working on making dependent priors, i.e. p(phi | T) =\= p(phi)
-- Returns:
      - prior_statevars   prior probability of the state variables assuming
                          the distribution given in pdf_type

############## 3. Get likelihood for Vs, Q ##############
Likelihood is the probability of getting the observed Vs or Q given the assumed
state variable values.
The likelihood p(D|A), e.g., P(Vs | T, phi, gs), is calculated using
the residual (See manual, Menke book Ch 11):
     p(D|A) = 1 / sqrt(2 * pi * residual) * exp(-residual / 2)
residual(k) here is a chi-squared residual. Given chi-square, the PDF
of data with a normal distribution:
     P = 1 / sqrt(2 * pi * sigma^2) * exp(-0.5 * chi-square)
where sigma = std of data, chi-square=sum((x_obs - x_preds)^2 / sigma^2)
e.g. www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/statistics/recommendations/modeling.html

--- Things you should change:
      - This should be fine as is.
-- Functions called:
      - ../vbr/6_FitVobs/matlab_FittingFunctions/probability_distributions()
          This takes the observed value and standard deviation of the seismic
          property and compares it to the calculated value across all the
          combinations of the state variables that have been calculated to
          return the likelihood based on the formula described above.
-- Returns:
      - likelihood_[Vs|Q]  (n_T, n_phi, n_gs) matrix of the likelihood of
                               Vs or Q given the relevant combination of
                               the state variables

############## 4. Get posterior for State Variables ##############
Calculate the posterior probablity in a Bayesian way - p(S|D) = p(D|S)p(S)/p(D)
and then plot it.  This is for Q and Vs individually.  Note that we discard
the normalising factor, p(D).
* Working out the normalisation should help us with hypothesis testing.

--- Things you should change:
      - This should be fine as is.
--- Functions called:
      - ../vbr/6_FitVobs/matlab_FittingFunctions/probability_distributions()
          This is being used to calculate the posterior distribution
      - plot_Bayes()
          Plot the posterior pdf
      - plot_tradeoffs_posterior()
          Plot the posterior as a function of two of the three state Variables
          so the tradeoffs can be visualised easily
--- Returns:
      - posterior_S_given_[Vs|Q]  (n_T, n_phi, n_gs) matrix of the posterior
                                  probability of the state variables given Vs or Q
      - Figures showing the posterior pdf given Vs or Q

########### 5. Get posterior for State Variables given both Vs and Q ###########
Calculate the posterior in a joint sense given constraints from both Vs and Q.
We cannot calculate the absolute probability because we do not know p(Vs, Q).
However, for a given location (i.e. fixed Vs and Q), we can assume that this
is a constant scaling and just remove it from our calculation.  In which case,
    p(S | (Vs, Q)) ∝ p(Vs | S) * p(Q | S) * p(S)
(see Manual).

--- Things you should change:
      - This should be fine as is.
--- Functions called:
      - plot_Bayes()
          Plot the posterior pdf
      - plot_tradeoffs_posterior()
          Plot the posterior as a function of two of the three state Variables
          so the tradeoffs can be visualised easily
--- Returns:
      - posterior_S_given_Vs_and_Q   (n_T, n_phi, n_gs) matrix of the
                                     posterior probability of the state
                                    variables given both Vs and Q

######## End of fit_seismic_observations ##########
If calling this as a function rather than section by section,
--- Returns:
    - posterior         structure containing the best posterior distribution
                        that you calculated and details of the state variables
                        you tested.

######################### Start of fit_plate ###########################


#############  1. Load 1D Thermal models ################
The thermal modelling takes quite a long time, so it is recommended that
you load in a previously calculated box.  However, if you want to test
a different range of potential temperatures and thermal plate thicknesses,
you will need to have a different SV_Box.
--- Things you should change:
      - Files.SV_Box    the file name of your previously calculated 1D models
      - If you want to recalculate, alter the variables in the if statement
          LABsweep.TpC - vector of possible potential temperatures, [degrees C]
          LABsweep.zPlatekm - vector of possible thermal plate thicknesses [km]
--- Functions called:
      - generate_boxes_ThermalEvolution()
          Calculates a suite of 1D thermal models based on your input potential
          temperature and thermal plate thicknesses
--- Returns:
      - Box         Box of 1D plate models, output of 1D thermal modelling
      - LABsweep    Structure with fields recording the potential temperature
                    and thermal plate thickness ranges (TpC, zPlatekm)

#############  2. Get the prior for Potential Temperature ################
Based on the Bayesian analysis done above, we can find the marginal probability
of each of our input potential temperatures.
--- Things you should change:
      - This assumes you are using asthenospheric Vs and/or Q constraints.
        If you have other constraints of Tp (e.g. geothermobarometry), then
        you can replace p_Tp with your other constraints.
--- Functions called:
      - N/A
--- Returns:
      - Tp_vals       vector of potential temperature values
      - p_Tp          estimated probability of each of those values

#############  3. Calculate seismic LAB depth (zLAB) ################
Based on your sweep of potential temperature and thermal plate thickness, you
can calculate an estimate for the depth of the seismic LAB.  (It is hardwired
in calc_LAB_Vs that you are setting the seismic LAB to the point where the Q
is 10 times higher than the average in the adiabatic region of the model).
--- Things you should change:
      - LAB_settings        structure containing parameters for the LAB
                            calculation, e.g. appropriate period band, q_method
--- Functions called:
      - calc_LAB_Vs()
          Calculates the LAB for every Q profile in a given VBR Box
--- Returns:
      - zLAB_grid         a grid of calculated zLAB for a sweep in Tp and zPlate
      - A figure showing zLAB_grid

##########  4. Get prior on seismic LAB depth from observations #############
This section loads in the seismic LAB observations, and extracts the observed
data point and its standard deviation.  It calculates a prior probability on
this data assuming a normal distribution.

The seismic observations are assumed to be saved in some file, xxxx.mat,
that contains a single variable (name irrelevant, as it is renamed to Model)
[obs_name]_Model    structure with the following fields
   Latitude    n_lat vector of latitude points [degrees N]
   Longitude   n_lon vector of longitude points [degrees E]
                (can be negative - code will add 360 degrees to negative values)
  Depth        n_dep vector of depth points [km]
  [obs_name]  (n_lat, n_lon, n_dep) matrix of values of this
               seismic property based on observations
  Error       (n_lat, n_lon, n_dep) matrix of uncertainty of this seismic
              property based on observations. This is often not reported!
              As such, if there is no such field in the saved .mat file,
              a default value is assumed, with a message printed to screen.

--- Things you should change:
      - location.lat, location.lon - (lat, lon) of your desired point
              This should be the same as the location your asthenospheric
              Vs and/or Q observations were taken from
      - filenames.LAB - the filenames of the saved seismic observations in the
                        format described above
--- Functions called:
      - functions/process_SeismicModels()
          This returns the observed value and standard deviation
          given an input location and model file
      - ../vbr/6_FitVobs/matlab_FittingFunctions/probability_distributions()
          This is used to calculate a normal distribution
--- Returns:
      - obs_LAB     value of seismic observation at location
      - sigma_LAB   standard deviation of seismic observation at location
      - zLAB_vals   vector of possible zLAB values
      - p_zLAB      probabability of zLAB_vals assuming a normal distribution

##########  5. Monte Carlo analysis #############
Calculate a cumulative distribution function for both zLAB and Tp.  These two
distributions are independently constrained, so we can just pick random values
from each, using this cdf.  For some large number of trials, find the zPlate
value that corresponds to the randomly selected zLAB and Tp - this will tend
to approximate the true distribution of zPlate for large N.
* This currently uses scatteredInterpolant, a built in MATLAB function that
is not available in Octave.
--- Things you should change:
      - n_MC_trials     if this is running slowly, you could make this smaller
--- Functions called:
      - plot_plates()
          This returns various plots - the estimated probability distributions
          for zPlate, zLAB and Tp; the geotherms and their corresponding Vs and
          Q profiles where opacity is scaled by the estimated probability of
          that geotherm given the Monte Carlo analysis - black squares on these
          profiles mark the depth of the calculated seismic LAB.
--- Returns:
      - posterior     strucutre containing the estimated distribution and
                      results of the Monte Carlo analysis
      - Plots showing the estimated pdfs and likeliest T, Vs, and Q profiles

################### End of fit_plate ######################
If calling this as a function rather than section by section,

                        that you calculated and details of the variables
                        you tested.
