# `HS1962`

The `HS1962` geophysical mixing model relates the bulk conductivity of two phases to the amount of each phase present by volume fraction. The model infers a spherical geometry with phase 1 making up the core and the phase 2 being the surrounding shell with interconnected channels. Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds has the more conductive phase as the outer shell and the most resistive phase as its inner shell, while the lower bounds is the converse. Cited directly from Glover (2010), "A generalized Archieâ€™s law for n phases", GEOPHYSICS, VOL. 75, NO. 6, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.3509781).

## Requires:
* `VBR.out.(method_1).esig`
* `VBR.out.(method_2).esig` 

## Calling Procedure

```matlab
% set required state variables (for method_1 & method_2)
clear
VBR.in.SV.T_K = linspace(600,1700,21) + 273; % temperature [K]
VBR.in.SV.ch20 = linspace(0,1000,11); % water content [ppm]

% add to electric methods list
VBR.in.electric.methods_list={'(method_1)','(method_2)};

% call VBR_spine
[VBR] = VBR_spine(VBR);

% call Hashin-Shtrikman
VBR.in.SV.phi = 0.1; % v_f 
[VBR] = ec_HS1962(VBR, method_1, method_2) 
```

## Output
Output is `VBR.out.electric.HS.esig`, the electrical conductivity of Olivine in S/m.
