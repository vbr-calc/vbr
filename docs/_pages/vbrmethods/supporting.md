In addition to the methods for calculating viscous, elastic and anelastic properties, there are a number of additional functions that you may find useful, including functions related to calculating other thermodynamic properties as well as general use or developer-focused functions. See the [Supporting Functions](/vbr/vbrmethods/support/support/) for a detailed list of all the functions.
